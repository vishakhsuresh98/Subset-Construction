Subset Construction
*******************

This is a lex program which accepts an NFA from file and performs subset construction and produces an equivalent DFA.



To run the lex program
********************** 

1. Go the directory where the file is present.

2. To build the lex program, type make into the terminal.

3. The lex program has now been built and the executable file mylex is ready.

4. To run the executable file, type
   ./mylex (number of states) (number of final states) (number of symbols in the alphabet)

5. To remove the unnecessay files, type make remove into the terminal
   The executable file mylex and lex.yy.c will be removed


NOTE: An input.txt file and a specification.txt file has been attached.
      specification.txt specifies an NFA which accepts those string over the alphabet {a} which have either
      1. even number of occurrences of a or
      2. number of occurrences of a that is a multiple of 3
